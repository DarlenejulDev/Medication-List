Sometime it is hard to remember which medication needs to be taken for the day and also to know if you have taken them already. There is just so much that goes on throughout the day.
Here's the Medication List Application that can help you to keep track of the medication you have taken for the day. Once you have taken your pill, click the "checkbox". If you have to take the same medication more than once, click the echeckbox for every time you have taken your pill. Once you are done for the day, delete your entries for a fresh start the next day. :)
